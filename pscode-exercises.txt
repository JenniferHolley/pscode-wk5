// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

BEGIN
NUMBER s1, s2, sum
OUTPUT("Input number1:")
INPUT s1
OUTPUT("Input number2:")
INPUT s2
sum=s1+s2
OUTPUT sum
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Start
Print "Enter Any Number to Check, Even or Odd"
Read input of a number
If number mod = 0
	Print "Number is Even"
Else
	Print "Number is Odd"
End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

START
input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5
small = n1
large = n1
for i = 2 to 5:
   if n1 > ni then:
       small = ni
   if n1 < ni then:
       large = ni
print("Average:", avg)
print("Smallest:", small)
print("Largest:", large)

#Get inputs for the 5 values.
	The Average of the 5 values is calculated.
#Line 5 iterates the numbers and within the iteration, there are 2 conditional statements that calculate the smallest and largest values.

#The last three lines print the average, the smallest and the largest input.
